# Seabay Proxy 🐡🦈🐠
This is a mobile-ready proxy for Seabay, an eBay clone. 

# Motivation
This service is part of a front-end capstone project that I was a part of at Hack Reactor. There is an accompanying shopping cart service that I created [here](https://github.com/seabay-hratx42-fec/shopping-cart/).
